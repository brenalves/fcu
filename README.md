# Gravitum Flight Control Unit

Author: Breno Soares Alves

That project aims to assembly from scratch a flight control unit capable of GNSS-waypoint navigation to my undergraduate work in Computer Science in Federal University of Fronteira Sul. The Gravitum FCU encapsulates basic components to achieve great reliability and precision with embedded sensors, supply management, channels for output servos and extra modules.

That repository maintain each process to reach the final result. The project structure is organized as follow:

- /airplane: Project for self-made single engine, electric fixed wing aircraft. Here you may find 3D Models, annotations and schematics;
- /doc: Monography of the project, documental final result for the entire project;
- /pcb: Project for the Printed Circuit Board (Hardware). Here you may find electrical information, schematics, annotations and the board itself. Software: KICAD;
- /src: Project for the library and drivers (Software) that will control the airplane using the hardware. Here you will find the source code of each driver for sensors, PWM, comms protocols and etc. Software: STM32CUBEIDE.
